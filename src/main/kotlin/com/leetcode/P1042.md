## 1042. Flower Planting With No Adjacent

You have N gardens, labelled `1` to `N`.  In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

`paths[i] = [x, y]` describes the existence of a bidirectional path from garden `x` to garden `y`.

Also, there is no garden that has more than 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Return **any** such a choice as an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the type of flower planted in the `(i+1)`-th garden.  The flower types are denoted `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`.  It is guaranteed an answer exists.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: N = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,1,2]
```

##### Example 3:

```
Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

##### Note:

* `1 <= N <= 10000`
* `0 <= paths.size <= 20000`
* No garden has 4 or more paths coming into or leaving it.
* It is guaranteed an answer exists.

#### Hint 1

Since each garden is connected to at most 3 gardens, there's always an available color for each garden. For example, if one garden is next to gardens with colors 1, 3, 4, then color #2 is available.
