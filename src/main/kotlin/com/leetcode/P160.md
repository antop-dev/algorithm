## 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

begin to intersect at node c1.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
```

Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.

##### Example 2:

```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
```

Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

##### Example 3:

```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
```

Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

##### Notes:

* If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
* The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
* You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
* Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

## 풀이

1. `headA + headB`, `headB + headA` 만큼 순회 하면서 교차 노드가 있는지 체크한다.
2. 각각 순회를 끝내도 교차 노드가 없으면 `null`을 리턴한다.<br>
    이 기준을 판단하는 방법으로 `A->B`, `B->A` 로 바뀔 때마다 카운트 변수를 증가 시킨 후 카운트가 2보다 크면 끝까지 다 순회한 것으로 판단했다.

##### Example 3:

한번씩 순회를 하고 다시 순회를 할때 카운트 변수<sup>`c`</sup>는 2를 초과하게 된다.

`null` 리턴
