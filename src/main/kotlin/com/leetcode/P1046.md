## 1046. Last Stone Weight

We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two **heaviest** stones and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`.  The result of this smash is:

If `x == y`, both stones are totally destroyed;
If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y-x`.
At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

##### Example 1:

```
Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.
```

##### Note:

* `1 <= stones.length <= 30`
* `1 <= stones[i] <= 1000`

#### Hint 1

Simulate the process. We can do it with a heap, or by sorting some list of stones every time we take a turn.
