## 1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree `root`, a ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follow:

* Choose **any** node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).
* If the current direction is right then move to the right child of the current node otherwise move to the left child.
* Change the direction from right to left or right to left.
* Repeat the second and third step until you can't move in the tree.

Zigzag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1. (A single node has a length of 0).

Return the longest **ZigZag** path contained in that tree.

```
Input: root = [1,null,1,1,1,null,null,1,1,null,1,null,null,null,1,null,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (right -> left -> right).
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input: root = [1,1,1,null,1,null,null,1,1,null,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (left -> right -> left -> right).
```

##### Example 3:


```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 0
```

##### Constraints:

* Each tree has at most 50000 nodes..
* Each node's value is between [1, 100].

#### Hint 1

Create this function maxZigZag(node, direction) maximum zigzag given a node and direction (right or left).

## Solution

방향과 길이를 동시에 다루는 `direction`이라는 인자를 이용해서 재귀한다(?).
