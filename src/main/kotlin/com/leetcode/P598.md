## 598. Range Addition II

Given an m * n matrix **M** initialized with all **0**'s and several update operations.

Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with two **positive** integers **a** and **b**, which means `M[i][j]` should be **added by one** for all `0 <= i < a` and `0 <= j < b`.

You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: 
m = 3, n = 3
operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Initially, M = 
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [2,2], M = 
[[1, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [3,3], M = 
[[2, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]

So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.
```

##### Note:

1. The range of m and n is [1,40000].
2. The range of a is [1,m], and the range of b is [1,n].
3. The range of operations size won't exceed 10,000.
