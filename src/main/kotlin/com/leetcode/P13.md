## 9. Palindrome Number

https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, two is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X` + `II`. The number twenty seven is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
* X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
* C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: "III"
Output: 3
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input: "IV"
Output: 4
```

##### Example 3:

```
Input: "IX"
Output: 9
```

##### Example 4:

```
Input: "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
```

##### Example 5:

```
Input: "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

#### Hint 1

I - 1<br>
V - 5<br>
X - 10<br>
L - 50<br>
C - 100<br>
D - 500<br>
M - 1000<br>

#### Hint 2

* If I comes before V or X, subtract 1 eg: IV = 4 and IX = 9
* If X comes before L or C, subtract 10 eg: XL = 40 and XC = 90
* If C comes before D or M, subtract 100 eg: CD = 400 and CM = 900

1. 뒤에서부터 한글자씩 가져와서 해당하는 숫자를 더한다.
2. **현재 위치의 글자**와 **바로 전 글자**(현재 글자의 뒤 글자)가 특정 조건에 맞으면 뺀다.

##### Example 1:

```
c = I, prev =  , n =     1, sum =     1
c = I, prev = I, n =     1, sum =     2
c = I, prev = I, n =     1, sum =     3
``` 

##### Example 2:

```
c = V, prev =  , n =     5, sum =     5
c = I, prev = V, n =    -1, sum =     4
```

##### Example 3:

```
c = X, prev =  , n =    10, sum =    10
c = I, prev = X, n =    -1, sum =     9
```

##### Example 4:

```
c = I, prev =  , n =     1, sum =     1
c = I, prev = I, n =     1, sum =     2
c = I, prev = I, n =     1, sum =     3
c = V, prev = I, n =     5, sum =     8
c = L, prev = V, n =    50, sum =    58
```

##### Example 5:

```
c = V, prev =  , n =     5, sum =     5
c = I, prev = V, n =    -1, sum =     4
c = C, prev = I, n =   100, sum =   104
c = X, prev = C, n =   -10, sum =    94
c = M, prev = X, n =  1000, sum =  1094
c = C, prev = M, n =  -100, sum =   994
c = M, prev = C, n =  1000, sum =  1994
