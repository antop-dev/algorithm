## 1529. Bulb Switcher IV

There is a room with `n` bulbs, numbered from `0` to `n-1`, arranged in a row from left to right. Initially all the bulbs are **turned off**.

Your task is to obtain the configuration represented by `target` where `target[i]` is '1' if the i-th bulb is turned on and is '0' if it is turned off.

You have a switch to flip the state of the bulb, a flip operation is defined as follows:

* Choose any bulb (index `i`) of your current configuration.
* Flip each bulb from index `i` to `n-1`.

When any bulb is flipped it means that if it is 0 it changes to 1 and if it is 1 it changes to 0.

Return the **minimum** number of flips required to form `target`.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: target = "10111"
Output: 3
Explanation: Initial configuration "00000".
flip from the third bulb:  "00000" -> "00111"
flip from the first bulb:  "00111" -> "11000"
flip from the second bulb:  "11000" -> "10111"
We need at least 3 flip operations to form target.
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input: target = "101"
Output: 3
Explanation: "000" -> "111" -> "100" -> "101".
```

##### Example 3:


```
Input: target = "00000"
Output: 0
```

##### Example 4:

```
Input: target = "001011101"
Output: 5
```

##### Constraints:

* `1 <= target.length <= 10^5`
* `target[i] == '0'` or `target[i] == '1'`

#### Hint 1

Consider a strategy where the choice of bulb with number i is increasing. In such a strategy, you no longer need to worry about bulbs that have been set to the left.

## Solution

현재 위치의 전구를 키거나 끄면 그 전구의 오른쪽은 전부 켜지거나 꺼지게 된다.

이 특성(?)을 이용해 내가 지금까지 몇번 껏다 켰는지에 따라 다음 전구의 상태를 알 수 있다. 홀수: `1` 짝수: `0`
