## 783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes

Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node `root`, return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

##### Example : 

```
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.

The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:

          4
        /   \
      2      6
     / \    
    1   3  

while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.
```

##### Note:

1. The size of the BST will be between 2 and 100.
2. The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's value is different.
3. This question is the same as 530: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/

## 풀이

BST<sup>`Binary Search Tree`를 리스트<sup>`List`</sup>로 변환 후 각 요소<sup>`Element`</sup>들의 차이 중 최소 값을 구했다.

##### Example 1:

```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
  2 - 1 = 1
  3 - 2 = 1
  4 - 3 = 1
  6 - 4 = 2
```

##### Example 2:

![](https://i.imgur.com/m2jafqJ.png)

```
nums = [49, 52, 69, 89, 90]
  52 - 49 = 3
  69 - 52 = 17
  89 - 69 = 20
  90 - 89 = 1
```
